# Digital Circuit Simulator

This project is based on [one of the project](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_sec_3.3.4) of the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html). The original project was written in LISP. The current project is about implementing of the original algorithm with javascript using different approaches.

> Designing complex digital systems, such as computers, is an important engineering activity. Digital systems are constructed by interconnecting simple elements. Although the behavior of these individual elements is simple, networks of them can have very complex behavior. Computer simulation of proposed circuit designs is an important tool used by digital systems engineers. In this section we design a system for performing digital logic simulations. This system typifies a kind of program called an event-driven simulation, in which actions ("events") trigger further events that happen at a later time, which in turn trigger more events, and so so.

As a demo, we simulate the working of the half adder circuit:
